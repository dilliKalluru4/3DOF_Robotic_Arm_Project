# 3DOF_Robotic_Arm_Project
Python-based simulation and visualization of a 3-DOF robotic arm, implementing Inverse Kinematics (IK), Forward Kinematics (FK), and workspace analysis. The project includes 3D plotting of arm movement and trajectory planning, with data logging in CSV/JSON formats for analysis.
