# 3DOF_Robotic_Arm_Project

This project simulates the operation of a 3D robotic arm, focusing on inverse kinematics and trajectory generation. It includes visualization of the robot's movement and its end-effector positions in a 3D space, simulating how the arm would interact with different target points.

The project uses:

1.Python's `numpy` library for mathematical calculations

2.Servo motor control functions to simulate movement

3.Visualization through `matplotlib` for the 3D plotting of the robotic arm's trajectory

Features

1.Inverse Kinematics (IK): Calculates joint angles based on desired end-effector positions.

2.Servo Motor Simulation: Simulates the movement of servos based on calculated joint angles.

3.3D Visualization: Displays the trajectory of the robotic arm's end-effector in 3D space.

4.Gripper Control: Includes the functionality to control the gripper to open and close.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
