# 3DOF_Robotic_Arm_Project

This project simulates the operation of a 3D robotic arm, focusing on inverse kinematics and trajectory generation. It includes visualization of the robot's movement and its end-effector positions in a 3D space, simulating how the arm would interact with different target points.
The project uses:
- Python's `numpy` library for mathematical calculations
- Servo motor control functions to simulate movement
- Visualization through `matplotlib` for the 3D plotting of the robotic arm's trajectory
  Features
- Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Calculates joint angles based on desired end-effector positions.
- Servo Motor Simulation**: Simulates the movement of servos based on calculated joint angles.
- 3D Visualization**: Displays the trajectory of the robotic arm's end-effector in 3D space.
- Gripper Control**: Includes the functionality to control the gripper to open and close.
  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
